This is a Sudoku game built atop HTML5's DBStorage API.  A working version
can be used at:

http://rickosborne.org/html5-dbstorage-sudoku/

It requires a browser that supports the HTML5 DBStorage API, as well as the
Canvas element.  As of this writing, this includes Opera 10.5 and WebKit,
but not Firefox 3.6 or Internet Explorer.
