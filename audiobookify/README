Audiobookify is a perl script I wrote to help me convert a directory of
CD-ripped MP3 files into an iPod-compatible M4B file.  It depends on a number
of free programs that I won't outline here -- you'll have to dig through the
source.  With minimal tweaking, it does work on Windows, Linux, and OSX.

Since iPods don't like M4B files longer than ~5.5hrs, this script tries to
combine the MP3 files in such a way as to get approximately equi-time files
without going over that limit.  I'm not interested in solving the Knapsack
Problem, so it's not perfect, but it does a decent job of figuring out
splits -- especially if you use the --margin option.

It will also use the appropriate tools to create chapter marks for each MP3,
or with the --noempty, --skipre, or --onyre options, for each meaningful MP3
title.

If you have a JPEG image in the current directory, it will try to use it as
cover art.

General workflow:
 * Run the script once to see where the guesstimated splits are.
 * Add --skipre to not chapterize in the wrong places
 * Add --splits to make sure you don't split in the middle of a chapter,
   and/or tweak the --margin to make it guess better.

For best results, name your parent directory 'Artist (Year) Album'.  It'll
try to get Artist, Year, and Album from the ID3 tags, but on multi-disc sets
you'll be lucky if some of the discs aren't mis-coded.


Usage:
audiobookify.pl
  --performer 'name'
  --margin 1.1        Modify the wiggle room left in files.
  --splits '1,3,5'    Split for new M4B files at specific MP3s (chapters, etc).
  --noempty           Don't make chapter marks for files with empty titles.
  --quality 80        Quantization quality for FFMPEG.
  --skipre 'regex'    Regular expression of MP3 titles to ignore (not chapters)
  --onlyre 'regex'    RegEx of MP3 titles to chapterize (ignoring others)
  --verbose           Show all files, even non-chapter markers


OTHER TOOLS

There are a few other Perl scripts that I've whipped up to convert CUE files
to POD files, etc.  They were sort of the alpha versions of audiobookify and
are preserved here for posterity.
