This is a barebones iCal (.ics) reader/writer.  If you are interested in
using iCal files from ColdFusion, you should probably try Ray Camden's
CFC first:

If you are determined to use this one, it requires a template ICS file
to kick-start it.  One has been provided here, and you should probably
customize it.

The handling of timezones is a mess.  If you want to use them, you'll
need to hack it in.
