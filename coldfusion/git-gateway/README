This is a pair of ColdFusion gateway components that work together to
watch a Git repository for commits and then IM you the short commit
messages over XMPP/Jabber.

It's really basic for now, but it works.

TODO:

 * Ability to watch multiple repos with the same chat bot.
 * Ability to manage subscriptions to specific repos.
 * Ability to customize chat messages.
